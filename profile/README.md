## Hi there 👋 Welcome at our PPF-Alpine Github account!

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction 

We are a cross-disciplinary research group based at the Department of Biological Sciences and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bergen (Norway), working at the interface of biology, geology, and climatology. Our group aims at developing a mechanistic understanding of the role of the dynamic past in shaping present-day patterns of mountain biodiversity and improving predictions for the future.

Our project – The Past, Present and Future of Alpine Biomes Worldwide (PPF-Alpine) – aims to take a deep dive into the biogeographical history of alpine systems on a global scale and decipher the drivers of present-day alpine biodiversity.
